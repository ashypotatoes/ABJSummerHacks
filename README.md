# COVIDTexas
COVIDTexas is a project that we worked on as a part of the FreeTail Hackers SummerHacks 2020 Hackathon (https://freetailhackers.com/summerhacks/). The project is an iOS application that presents COVID-19 data of Texas and the counties that are in it. We built this in hopes to raise awareness about the global pandemic that is occurring at this time.

<!-- The purpose of creating this project was to help users understand the current status of the global pandemic occurring through the illustration of COVID-19 data within the state of Texas and providing relevant news articles. We believed that through this, we could raise enough awareness to hopefully freeze the growing number of cases and bring an end to this pandemic -->

## Installation
We did not upload our app onto the App Store. However, you can clone this repository or download it as a zip file and run the program through Xcode if you would like.

## Usage
Run the app on your computer in order to see the number of cases and deaths for the state of Texas and some of the counties that are in it. You can also view news articles being distributed around the US that are related to COVID-19.
